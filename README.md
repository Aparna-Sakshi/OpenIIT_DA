OpenIIT Data Analytics - Analysing trends in music data <br>
<p>
  The popularity of the music album was rated on a scale of 5. The problem was modeled as an ordinal regression task. In the preprocessing step, various transformations were applied to remove skewness and some new features were also added. Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation was used for feature selection and to remove multicollinearity. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced (i.e) there were very few labels of popularity rated as 5, training data was oversampled using SMOTE. Models like lighGBM, lasso regression, MLP classifier were implemented and the best results were observed in Random forest with penalization.
